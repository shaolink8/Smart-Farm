# Smart Farm

An attempt at executing ideas related to automating farms and assisting farmers. 

This is a project based entirely on Raspberry Pi.

<i>Refer to the prototype image for an overall idea.</i>

## "smartfarm123.py"

We've used moisture sensor, smoke sensor, ultrasonic sensors and a PiCam in our smart farm prototype.

- The ultrasonic sensors are installed on all 4 sides of the farm to warn about any intruder.

- The moisture sensor gives us an idea about the moisture content of the soil based on which we can make the choice of crop to be grown.

- The smoke sensor warns about any outbreak of fire and triggers a buzzer/ alarm in case such a situation was to take place.

## "plantdisease.py"

This code helps us identify if any plant is healthy or carries a disease with it just with one click of an image.
